dbr:Cầu_khỉ  rdfs:comment  "A cầu khỉ (\"monkey bridge\") in Vietnam is a handmade bamboo or wooden passway across a stream or gully. The \"monkey bridge\", as a uniquely Vietnamese traditional symbol, was the inspiration for the title of American author Lan Cao's novel Monkey Bridge. It is also called a coconut bridge (if made of coconut tree) or bamboo bridge (if made of bamboo). These bridges, with or without handrails, are very difficult and dangerous for those who are not accustomed to them. Those familiar with them have been known to carry on their shoulder 20–50 kg while on the bridge."@en ;
